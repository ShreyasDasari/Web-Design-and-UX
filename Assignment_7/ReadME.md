Assignment - 7 
SASS/SCSS

1. CSS Grid box: The CSS Grid Layout Module provides a grid-based layout system with rows and columns that makes designing web pages easier without the usage of floats and positions. To show images, I utilized the CSS grid layout.

2. CSS Flexbox Layout: The Flexbox Layout module strives to provide a more effective means of laying out, aligning, and distributing space among elements in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic. To display photos, I utilized the CSS flex layout.

3. Variables in SCSS: Sass variables are names that begin with $ that you assign a value to, and then you can refer to that name instead of the value itself.

4. Custom Properties: In CSS, a custom property is often thought of as a variable.

5. Nesting: Nesting is the combination of many logic structures. We can integrate numerous CSS rules within one another using SASS.

6. Interpolation: It uses # syntax to offer SassScript variables in selections and property names. Within the curly brackets, you can provide variables or property names. To display the contents, I used interpolation.

7. Placeholder selectors: A placeholder selector is a type of selection. It is employed when creating your own SASS library. Its operation is pretty similar to that of mixin without arguments. The placeholder selector begins with an a% symbol. I made a button out of placeholder.

8. Mixins: A mixin is a programming concept that allows a programmer to inject code into a class.

9. Functions: You can use functions to define complicated operations on SassScript values that you can reuse throughout your stylesheet. I declared a function that will output some statements.
