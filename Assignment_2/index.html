                <h2>Upcoming Data Scientist</h2>
                <p>My name is Shreyas, and I am a graduate student studying information systems and a young, motivated data scientist with
                a variety of skills. I have been working on and honing my machine learning, statistical modeling, and data visualization
                abilities since the beginning of my third year of my bachelor's degree in engineering. I've worked professionally with a
                multinational company Cognizant for nearly a year. I created a chatbot and a prediction model on real-world issues while
                I was an intern at Borgward Technologies Private Ltd. Additionally, I completed a research assistant internship working
                for the professor on the data-driven issue of neuromorphic computing at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology.
